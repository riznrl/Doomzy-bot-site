# Doomzy Bot Site


This is the official site interface for the **Doomzy** ecosystem. The project connects users via Discord and grants access only to approved community members. Windsurf handles deployments and UI improvements. This file outlines key behavior and expectations to keep development focused and safe.

## ðŸ”’ Access Control (Discord-Gated)

- All users **can visit the login page**, but **no access is granted by default**.
- The exception is the **admin user** (you) who bypasses restrictions.
- If a user is **not part of the Discord server**, they must:
  1. Fill out a **signup form** on the site.
  2. That form includes:
     - Full Name
     - Discord ID
     - Email
     - Reason for Joining
     - A **visual slider** to confirm submission
  3. The form is posted by the Discord bot into a **private channel** (e.g. `#signup-requests`).
  4. Admins review the form and change the user's **Discord role** if approved.
  5. Users with the correct role are allowed access on next login.

## âœ… Tomorrowâ€™s Task Coverage

These items are built or scheduled:
- [x] Real-time global feed (via Socket.io)
- [x] Site-wide persistent voice chat (under construction)
- [x] Custom user profiles with banner image
- [x] Clicking a user in a feed links to their profile
- [x] Role-based gating at login
- [x] `#signup-requests` approval queue from form
- [ ] Animated site announcement notification system
- [ ] Better skinning of VC UI
- [ ] Integrated header nav bar (`Global Feed`, `Search`, `Settings`, `Profile`)

## ðŸŒ‰ ControlBridge Integration

Doomzy includes a real-time command and log pipeline called **ControlBridge** that enables communication between your Discord bot, Windsurf, and Railway deployment.

### Running ControlBridge

```bash
# Start the controlbridge server
npm run controlbridge

# Or run both main server and controlbridge
npm start
```

### ControlBridge Endpoints

- **POST /log** - Receive logs from Discord bot
- **POST /windsurf-task** - Send tasks to Windsurf
- **GET /status** - Bridge health check
- **GET /logs** - View recent logs
- **GET /task** - View current Windsurf task
- **DELETE /logs** - Clear logs (requires admin token)

### Bot Integration

Update your Discord bot to send errors to ControlBridge:

```javascript
// Send errors to controlbridge
fetch("http://localhost:3001/log", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    log: "Error in signup processing: " + error.message
  })
});

// Send Windsurf tasks
fetch("http://localhost:3001/windsurf-task", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    task: "# Windsurf: fix file upload bug\n\nThe upload fails when files are null."
  })
});
```

### Task Executor

The system includes an automated **Task Executor** that monitors for new tasks and executes them automatically:

```bash
# Start the task executor (runs automatically with npm start)
npm run task-executor

# Or run independently
node task-executor.js
```

**How it works:**
1. Monitors `doomzy-controlbridge/windsurf-patch.md` every 10 seconds
2. Detects when new tasks are posted via `/windsurf-task` endpoint
3. Executes tasks automatically based on content analysis
4. Logs all actions back to the ControlBridge system
5. Updates task status checkboxes in the markdown file

### Complete System Integration

```bash
# Start everything together (recommended)
npm start

# This runs:
# âœ… Main web server on port 8080
# âœ… Discord bot integration
# âœ… HydraCheck validation on startup
# âœ… ControlBridge API on port 3001
# âœ… Task Executor monitoring
```

## ðŸ§ª HydraCheck Debug System

Doomzy includes a comprehensive debugging system called **HydraCheck** that validates all critical systems before deployment.

### Running HydraCheck

```bash
# Run comprehensive system validation
npm run debug
# or
npm test

# Or run directly
node hydraDebug.js
```

### What HydraCheck Validates

- âœ… **Environment Variables**: All required variables are present and valid
- âœ… **Discord Bot Connection**: Bot can login with proper intents
- âœ… **Server Health**: All endpoints respond correctly
- âœ… **API Routes**: Authentication and functionality work properly
- âœ… **File System**: Required directories and assets exist
- âœ… **Code Structure**: All imports and middleware load without errors

### HydraCheck Output

The system provides color-coded output:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: System working correctly
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Critical failure detected
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Warning or optional feature

### Debug Report

HydraCheck generates a detailed report in `hydra_debug_report.txt` with:
- Timestamped error logs
- Specific failure reasons
- Environment validation status
- API endpoint health checks

### Railway Integration

The startup process automatically runs a lightweight version of HydraCheck before starting the server:

```bash
npm start  # Runs HydraCheck validation then starts server
```
